Your OS and your terminal intercept many key combinations, and hide the modifiers of some.
This makes defining keybindings for terminal applications often challenging.

**print_key** helps you determine the available key combinations for terminal applications, and how those terminal applications receive them.

Key combinations are printed the way the can be written in key binding configurations of programs such as [broot](https://dystroy.org/broot) or [bacon](https://dystroy.org/bacon).

Precompiled binaries are available at [https://dystroy.org/print_key/download](https://dystroy.org/print_key/download).
